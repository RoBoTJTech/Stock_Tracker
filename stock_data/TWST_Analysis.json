#### Risk Factors
1. **High Burn Rate**: Persistently negative EBITDA and free cash flow indicate a high burn rate that could impact sustainability.
2. **Market Volatility**: A beta of 1.798 suggests higher market volatility.
3. **Financial Health**: While the company has sufficient liquidity ratios, the continued losses may pose long-term risks if not mitigated.

#### Swing Trading Potential
- Given the recent upswing in price relative to its moving averages and the relatively high beta, there might be swing trading opportunities especially around earnings announcements or major corporate developments.

#### Risk Assessment (Tolerance: 7)
- TWIST has significant volatility and financial risk given its operational losses and dependency on market conditions for its high valuation. However, strong analyst support and recent price performance may offer trading opportunities for those with a higher risk tolerance.

### Trade Status
